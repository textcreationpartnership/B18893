            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And if then the matters offered shall answer expectation, and savour of Above, may your Wisdomes cheerfully give them life and being for the publick good. If otherwise, let them be blasted with the doom due to such importunate presumption.</p>

               <head>Annotations on the Designe of Bathes.</head>
               <p>THese are no low dishonourable Designes having been (formerly) the profuse Magnificence of mighty<note n="a" place="margin">Vespasian, Dioclesian, <hi>and</hi> Maximian, Trajan, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Septimius Severus, Nero, <hi>and</hi> Alexander Severus, Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, &amp;c.</note> Cesars.</p>
               <p>They are no foolish Novelties, nor antiquated Chymera's or Absurdities, having been used and approved in all ages, and now lately an Octroy of them granted from the States of the<note n="b" place="margin">The States Octroy.</note> Low-Countries, the wisdome of whose councels manifest daily how solid they are, in being honoured, feared, and loved of neighbours at home, and famed and obeyed abroad in both the Indies.</p>
               <p>They are not confined to hot or cold Countries, since they abound both in Turkie, Persia, Germany, Hungary, Denmark, Swedeland, Poland, and Moscovia, whose<note n="c" place="margin">Sands Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, Hackluits Voyages.</note> strong, great bodied, healthfull people, beautifull children, and easie births, give no small testimony to the use of Bathes. Nor are they limited to Winter or Summer, the Emperour<note n="d" place="margin">Jacobus Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note>
                  <hi>Aurelian</hi> having made his Trans-tiburine Bathes particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Winter, the rest being more for Summer. And<note n="e" place="margin">Lib. de salub. vict. ratione.</note>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> prescribeth the often use of them in Summer, lesse in Winter.</p>
               <p>They can be no prejudice to the State, since the example of all Countries (almost) in the World will vindicate their wisdomes in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving or building them: nor can they be at any losse, if it fall to the Authors share to undertake them, which he is willing to doe, when enabled by a Grant from the Parliament, considerable to the great expence and time of finishing so great a worke. Which kind of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement hath not been wanting from former Parliaments unto publike spirits, who have endeavoured a common good.</p>
               <p>They can be no grievance or Monopoly: 1. Because there are yet none in England, except the famous Bathes of Somersetshire, which are naturall, and differ in vertue; nor can each weak body or purse be conveyed to them. 2. None can be compelled to use them, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is left free to his owne choice and discretion. 3. They entrench not upon the priviledge of Bathing Tubs, or Sweating Cradles, any other pidling way; but bequeath them all to their old inconvenient uses.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Author humbly presents this publick designe to the publick purse for what magnificence shall be thought fit; and wholly<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his service in, or reward for the same to the Wisdome of the Parliament. If this be refused, then he desires, that all Physicians, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, or Apothecaries, or any Noblemen or Gentlemen would joyne in partnership with him, allowing him such a proportion in regard of his former and future expence, study, and care in the contriving and ordering the same, as may be agreed on between them, if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament shall think good so to grant it. But if all refuse, it can be no injustice to grant that to the Author and his heires (being his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture and designe for the publick good) which no man else will accept or undertake. 5. All Physicians, Surgeons, and Apothecaries, (paying the common price) are to have as free use of them for their Patients, as the Author, and appoint and provide what other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents they please. 6. Reasonable prices are intended. 7. All licentious incivilities will be prevented by severall places and times for men and women: And men to be attended by men, women by women. Lastly, whatsoever else may be thought fitting, may receive its order and encouragement from the wisdome and power of Parliament. And if the feare of abuse be objected: Epicures will be Epicures doe men what they can; therefore all men must not be forbidden meat, because some will be Gluttons: nor all men turne<note n="*" place="margin">Turkes may drink no wine.</note> Turkes, because some will be drunk. Thus much negatively to prevent Objections. Now to affirme Truths (according to the merit of the thing) would exact a Volume; but that is not intended here, onely some few heads are offered, and some principall authorities, reserving the rest, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the demonstrative Arguments, to future leisure or command.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the first place, we may safely affirme the benefit of cleanlinesse, which (certainly) will be controverted by none. Hence followes the prevention of the Plague, which naturally breeds and is contagious through<note n="f" place="margin">Ambros. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus de Peste.

               <p>Hence result these Conclusions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as they beautifie the Cities where they are built, so they magnifie the wisdome of the Nations where they are, in providing so for the health and strength of the people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of so many benefits of preservation of health, prevention of the Plague, and cure of sicknesses, they may be constantly the saving of many thousand lives a yeare.</p>
